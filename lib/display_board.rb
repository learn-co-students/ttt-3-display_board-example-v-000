# Define a method display_board that prints a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe Boa
# **Board Rules**
#
# 1. Each cell is presented by a string with 3 spaces: <pre>"   "</pre>
# 2. Each row has 3 cells, the middle separated by 2 `|` (pipe) characters: <pre>   |   |   </pre>
# 3. There are 3 rows, with 2 separating lines of 11 `-` (dash) characters: `-----------`
#
# You can build a single big string and output it once or you can output each line individually. The end result when you execute your method should be the ascii characters above.
